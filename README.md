# Commentator

Playing with making a SublimeText3 plugin.

This is intended to be a quick and dirty QOL improvement for the short term. Who knows if it'll grow much beyond that.

# CommentatorEsdoc.py
Assuming we ever add more to this project, this file is the one to start at when looking at how and why we do what we
do. It is the first one added and will be way more extensively (excessively) commented for the sake of easily seeing
how to make future commands once we've stepped away and forgotten all about how SublimeText3's API works.
